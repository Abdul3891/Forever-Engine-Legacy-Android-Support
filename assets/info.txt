you might notice that there's a lot of new files in here
keep in mind that by default, only the "characterList" actually works
for "stageList" and "assetModifiersList" to work, simply go into the source code
go to "meta/data/ChartParser", and change the songType variable to "FOREVER_UNDERSCORE" (without quotes)

you will then be able to use stuff such as Asset Skins
Switch Stages and GF Versions using the Chart Editor
use notetypes and much more!
